Stop all outgoing emails sent from WordPress.

== Description ==

Stops outgoing emails sent from WordPress.  This plugin stops
outgoing emails generated by WordPress core, plugins, and themes.
Emails sent using the `wp_mail()` function, will not be sent.
In the case where an author does not use the recommended `wp_mail()`
function and instead sends the email using another mechanism, an email will
still be sent.

This plugin allows you to suspend sending emails when doing development work.
Any calls to `wp_mail()` will fail silently.  WordPress
will operate as if the email were sent successfully
but no email will actually be sent.

On the admin menu page Settings > Stop Emails, there is the option
to log all emails to the PHP error log.  By default this logging is
disabled.

NOTE: If using the PHP `mail()` function directly, this
plugin will NOT stop the emails.

== Installation ==

1. Install plugin from WordPress plugin repository http://wordpress.org/plugins/
2. Activate Stop Emails through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the entire `stop-emails` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate Stop Emails through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= mu-plugin Installation =

1.  If the directory `wp-content/mu-plugins/` does not exist, create it.
2.  Upload the single file `stop-emails.php` to the  `wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do the emails go? =

The emails are lost forever.

= Why are some of my emails still being sent? =

Most likely, this is due to a plugin you have running.
There are two different things the plugin could be
doing to cause emails to still be sent.

1. The plugin is overriding our overriding of the sending mechanism.
2. The plugin is calling the PHP function `mail()` directly.

Unfortunately in either of these cases, this plugin will not be able to stop
the email.

= I want to log the emails that are stopped =

You can enable logging of stopped emails on the
admin menu page Settings > Stop Emails.

Emails will be logged to your PHP error log.

= Why would I want install in the mu-plugins directory? =

Activating a plugin normally requires logging into the site.
Installing the file in the mu-plugins directory allows you to
activate the plugin without logging in.  This can be
helpful when setting up an existing site locally.

= Where can I report a bug? =

Please report bugs at https://github.com/salcode/stop-emails/issues

== Screenshots ==

1. When the plugin is running, there will be a warning on the backend of the website.
1. Lies! The email wasn't really sent, we're running Stop Emails
