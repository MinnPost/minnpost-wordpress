/**
 * This plugin will fix the problem where next/previous of page number buttons are broken on list
 * of posts in a category when the custom permalink string is:
 * /%category%/%postname%/ 
 * The problem is that with a url like this:
 * /categoryname/page/2
 * the 'page' looks like a post name, not the keyword "page"
