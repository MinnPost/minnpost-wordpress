    be restored by including `add_filter( 'media_credit_post_thumbnail_include_links', __return_true );`
    in the theme's `functions.php`.
*   "Display credit after posts" is now restricted to the proper single post view
    (and not every usage of `the_content` hook).

    for featured images".

    early.

    enabled.
