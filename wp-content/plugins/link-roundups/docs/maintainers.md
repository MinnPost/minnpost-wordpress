# Developer notes:

## Class Saved_Links_List_Table

See [the note in that class' directory](../inc/saved-links/README.md).

## Releasing updates

See https://github.com/INN/docs/blob/master/projects/wordpress-plugins/release.sh.md

The best thing to do is to copy that checklist into [a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/INN/link-roundups/issues/new) for each release of the plugin.
