If your permalink pattern uses %category% and also uses parent/child categories, WordPress will use both in the URL if applicable. This plugin simply removes the parent from the URL, so only the child is used.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `permalink-without-parent-categories` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
