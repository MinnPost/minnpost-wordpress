== Description ==

A boilerplate/starter extension for you to use as-is or fork.

Used as-is, an "Speaker" custom post type will be created and linked to The Events Calendar's Events, like Organizers are, and basic output will be added to the Single Event Page. See this plugin file's code comments for forking instructions.

== Installation ==

Install and activate like any other plugin!

* You can upload the plugin zip file via the *Plugins â€£ Add New* screen
* You can unzip the plugin and then upload to your plugin directory (typically _wp-content/plugins)_ via FTP
* Once it has been installed or uploaded, simply visit the main plugin list and activate it
