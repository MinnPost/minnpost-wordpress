== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is your documentation? =
You can find our documentation over on [our docs site](https://docs.wppopupmaker.com?utm_medium=text-doclink&utm_campaign=Readme&utm_source=readme-faq&utm_content=where-are-docs)

= How do I open a popup? =
Using "triggers", you can customize what makes each popup open. Review [our triggers documentation here](https://docs.wppopupmaker.com/article/141-triggers-cookies?utm_medium=text-doclink&utm_campaign=Readme&utm_source=readme-faq&utm_content=open-a-popup)

= How do I stop popups from opening repeatedly? =
Using "cookies", you can set up how long until the popup opens again, if ever. Review [our cookies documentation](https://docs.wppopupmaker.com/article/148-cookies?utm_medium=text-doclink&utm_campaign=Readme&utm_source=readme-faq&utm_content=stop-opening-repeatedly)

= What do I do if I want a popup to show only on a certain page/post/etc? =

= How do I make it work with my 3rd party forms? =
Beginning with Popup Maker v1.7, we now support most forms by default. We do this by adding a hidden field using JavaScript to any form inserted in a popup. This field contains the popup ID.

When we detect that ID in PHP, we queue up that popup to reopen immediately after refresh to show errors or success messages.

= How do I take advantage of the success actions Popup Maker provides for 3rd party forms? =
We have built-in support for the most popular form plugins. But if we don't, then we have a few helper functions that allow you to take full advantage of our success actions and setting cookies.

This link contains AJAX (JavaScript) & Non-AJAX (PHP) based solutions which you can hack with your forms hooks & events. https://gist.github.com/danieliser/0060112b18b6013f2683653236b02439
