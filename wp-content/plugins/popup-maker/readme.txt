= How do I make it work with my 3rd party forms? =
Beginning with Popup Maker v1.7 we now support most forms by default. We do this by adding a hidden field using JavaScript to any form inserted in a popup. This field contains the popup ID.

When we detect that ID in PHP we que up that popup to reopen immediately after refresh to show errors or success messages.

= How do I take advantage of the success actions Popup Maker provides for 3rd party forms? =
We have built in support for the most popular form plugins. But if we don't then we have a few helper functions that allow you to take full advantage of our success actions and setting cookies.

This link contains AJAX (JavaScript) & Non-AJAX (PHP) based solutions which you can hack with your forms hooks & events. https://gist.github.com/danieliser/0060112b18b6013f2683653236b02439
