== Note to Translators ==

If anyone would like to donate their talent and some time to translating into your language(s) and/or local dialect(s), it would be much appreciated. If you are interested being a translator, it's not hard to get started â€” just contact us and we'll get you set up: https://www.redsandmarketing.com/contact/ 

Or... you can translate directly on WordPress.org: https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-spamshield 
WordPress.org has established translation projects, making it easier than ever to translate plugins.

The older method of translating involves using .pot, .po, and .mo files.

This folder contains the MO files and the POT file. If you would like the PO files (for example if you want to improve an existing translation), you can download them here: https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wp-spamshield/branches/languages/ 

Thank you for your help making this a truly global plugin!
